* OPAQUE SASL bindings

This directory contains an OPAQUE SASL mech.

It works with cyrus-sasl, possibly also with libgsasl. dovecot-sasl is
rumored to not be supported, due to dovecot allegedly implementing
only 1 roundtrip - but this needs to be confirmed.

** Apache with SASL HTTP Authentication

It has been tested against Apache2 using this
https://gitlab.com/arpa2/apachemod/-/tree/master/arpa2_sasl module and
this python script as a client
https://github.com/stef/libopaque/blob/master/sasl/http_sasl.py

To make this work with apache, you need to add this to your /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

#+BEGIN_SAMPLE
LoadModule arpa2_sasl_module  /usr/lib/apache2/mod_arpa2_sasl.so
#+END_SAMPLE

And something like this to a directory stanza:

#+BEGIN_SAMPLE
AuthType SASL
AuthName "SASL http auth"
Require valid-user
SaslRealm localhost
SaslMechanisms OPAQUE
SaslDbPath /etc/sasldb2
#+END_SAMPLE

The file /etc/sasldb2 can be populated with entries like this:

#+BEGIN_SAMPLE
sudo saslpasswd2 -n -f /etc/sasldb2 -a http -c -u localhost $username
#+END_SAMPLE

You should make sure that the apache daemon can read the file /etc/sasldb2

There is also two firefox addons, which might or might not work:

 - https://gitlab.com/arpa2/http_sasl_client/
 - https://github.com/arpa2/http-sasl-plugin

It should be noted, that with OPAQUE every HTTP request requires 2
extra authentication requests to be made. It is not very practical for
humans to type in a password for every request, alternatively the
password could be cached, which is something no one would ever want.
Thus I'm considering a new post-opaque mechanism for doing 0 auth
roundtrips for requests over HTTP, the server and the client then both
have a shared secret after the first successful OPAQUE run and a
counter, and each request from the client contains a

#+BEGIN_SAMPLE
Authorization: hmac(shared_secret,counter++)
#+END_SAMPLE

header. This eliminates replay attacks, also there is no need for
caching or reusing the password. And I think this is a nice mechanism
for a lot of the other SASL mechanisms that are not 0rtt.

** Future work

No SSF has been implemented (although it would be easy, since
libsodium is already a dependency of libopaque.) This means you want
to wrap whatever you are running in TLS. However implementing an SSF
would make a lot of sense, since then OPAQUE is really used in both of
its benefits, authentication and establishment of a secure channel.
